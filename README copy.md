> **ℹ️ Personal Note**  
> This repository is part of my journey learning **JSON-RPC** in the context of blockchain development.  
> I’m documenting concepts, examples, and code snippets so I can use them later as a **reference** while building **dApps**, structuring **blockchains**, and handling **blockchain transactions** etc...
